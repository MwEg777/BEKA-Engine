# BEKA Engine
A Python-based 2D Game engine, inspired by Unity3D

Example project included.

---	***This game engine is based on Python and OpenGL. It only uses PyGame to load image files as strings, the rest is processed by the BEKA Game Engine.***

# Usage
1/Open GameLauncher.Py

2/Modify "Keeper" to your Game project file name. Eg: if your game file is called MyGame.Py, replace Keeper with MyGame

3/Run GameLauncher.Py


**-Note: PyGame is required to load images. To install it, open a cmd window then type: pip install pygame**
